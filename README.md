# Final_Project

This is My Final Project for Cyber Security Class 

Its Made up of 3 Sections, Offensive, Defensive and Network Module

In this project, I was able to hack into a target machine, get the required information and Analyze the information to see how to mitogate such attacks in the future

We Then used Wireshark to make a analysis on the network to view, downloaded files, hosts and the threats that can be posed to this Network
